Oh?
You found the github page, huh?
Heh... I can't stop you from searching through all the secrets of this site...
But where's the fun in brute forcing all the answers?
I must say, I can't say I'm not even a little proud of your commitment, going this far.
But if you're doing this just for my signature...
The tasks for his signature were clear from the very beginning.
And I made a point to mention that I cannot give you mine.
So if you're here only for something as superficial as that...
You've wasted your time.
If you want to get any closer to becoming part of his organization...
Your time is better spent with him than with me.






































But...
If you're here out of curiosity...
I can't stop you from scrolling and looking at all the files.
I'm disappointed at your refusal to have fun.
But I commend the power of your will.
People like you are exactly what my creation needs :)
